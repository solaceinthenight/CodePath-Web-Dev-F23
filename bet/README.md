# Bet Exemplar Lab

## Overview

Bet is a forum designed for Gen Z thrill-seekers where users can post challenges for other users. Users can take on a challenge by clicking the “Bet” button.

The user is able to perform all four CRUD operations: create a new challenge, read previous challenges, update a challenge, and delete a challenge.
